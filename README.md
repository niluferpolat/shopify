 This is the overall apparance the app that i've made. This is a simulation of any e-commerce app.

 I've designed it before i started coding it :) First of all,i searched  color schemas for the Shopify App. As i was searching,i learnt that orange color means energy and fun. I saw that some e-commerce websites such as Trendyol,Hepsiburada use orange color. So i chose my color palette as orange,white,grey and black. I've used Figma as a designing tool.

 As you can see, This filter eliminates the product by their categories. I fetched the category names from the FakeStoreAPI.

 Search button can work together with the filter. If there is text in it,you can delete it on cross icon which occurs if there is a text.

 When you add to the card with this button,the toast will inform you and the number on the basket icon updates itself.
 The products that you add are added into the localstorage.
 
 ![modal](https://github.com/niluferpolat/shopify/blob/main/resim_2022-02-05_145847.png)
 
 You can see the products in your basket on this modal with details such as unit price,how many added and name of the products and total.
 You can delete the products that you don't want to. After that,total,list and number on the basket icon will updated. 
 
 Technologies that i've used:
 
 * Javascript and ReactJS
 * Bootstrap for responsive look
 * CSS
 * Local Storage for basket operations
 * Axios for API request
